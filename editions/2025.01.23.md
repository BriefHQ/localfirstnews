### [Client state management, sync engines, and Foundry](https://bobbyfidz.tech/posts/client-state-management)
"What we really want is declarative data synchronization. React lets us describe how we want our UI to look as a function of our data, and it uses a reconciliation algorithm to efficiently coordinate updates to our UI. In the same way, we should be able to declare the data our UI needs, and a sync engine should work out how to efficiently fetch that data and keep it up-to-date in response to both local and remote changes."

### [We will rewrite SQLite. And we are going all-in | Turso](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in)
"libSQL proved our core thesis ‚Äì SQLite could indeed be more, and an open community is key to making that happen. But a fork, still tethered to its origin and moving cautiously, wasn't bold enough to generate the activation energy the community craved. A fresh, modern rewrite ‚Äì unconstrained by legacy architecture ‚Äì was what developers had been waiting for."
