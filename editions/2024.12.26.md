### [Show HN: Rivet Actors ‚Äì Durable Objects build with Rust, FoundationDB, Isolates](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42472519#42483497)
"One of the reasons we built Rivet Actors is because we tried to replace most of our Redis-based realtime infrastructure with Durable Objects." "The most common use cases are high contention & strong consistency workloads where using an OLTP database doesn't work well [...] For example ‚Äì I'm a big proponent of local-first apps, but even those require a sync server. You can easily implement one in under 100 lines of code with actors."
