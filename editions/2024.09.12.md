### [MongoDB Atlas Device Sync Deprecation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/device-sync-deprecation/)
Big news this week is that MongoDB deprecated their Atlas Device Sync product, which many developers used as a sync engine. "As of September 2024, Device Sync is deprecated for Atlas App Services. Device Sync will reach end-of-life and be removed on September 30, 2025. If you use Device Sync, you should migrate to alternative solution providers before Device Sync is removed." This has sparked fiery discussions on places like the [MongoDB Developer Community](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/device-sync-and-edge-server-are-deprecated/296035), [Twitter/X](https://x.com/philprimes/status/1833168514225496435) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mongodb/comments/1fct01v/fuck_you_mongodb/).
