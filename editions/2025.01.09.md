### [Back to Basics: Why We Chose Long Polling Over WebSockets](https://www.inferable.ai/blog/posts/postgres-nodejs-longpolling.mdx)
"Like many teams building real-time systems with Node.js and TypeScript, we've been exploring ways to handle real-time updates at scale. Our system handles hundreds of worker nodes constantly polling our PostgreSQL-backed control plane for new jobs (tool calls issued by agents), while agents themselves continuously pull for execution and chat state updates. What started as an exploration into WebSockets led us to a surprisingly effective "old-school" solution: HTTP long polling with Postgres."
