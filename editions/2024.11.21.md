### Local-first community on Bluesky
An active local-first community is emerging on Bluesky, a decentralized Twitter alternative [advised by Martin Kleppmann](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2024/02/06/bluesky-at-protocol.html). A number of “starter packs” ([1](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/ballingt.com/3laciq6amk72c), [2](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/schickling.dev/3l7zwgj5tl22f), [3](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/josiahwitt.com/3l7nyb3umi627), [4](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/paulbutler.org/3layneez4s52x)) have been created, and Jess Martin has [created a feed](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ydmqzovfn7leytozprtjyoox/feed/aaacw4673rzjw) aggregating posts that mention local-first.
