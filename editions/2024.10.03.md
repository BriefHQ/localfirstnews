### [Clace: AppServer for containerized web app development and deployment](https://github.com/claceio/clace)
"I have been building Clace, an application server for local-first software. Clace runs on your machine (Linux/macOS/Windows, using Docker or Podman) and allows you to install any number of web apps, from source code or from image. Apps scale down to zero when idle. Clace is the only local-first solution I am aware of  which supports this. This allows you to run many apps locally, without worrying about wasted CPU/memory resources." - Ajay on the [LoFi community](https://localfirstweb.dev/) Discord.
